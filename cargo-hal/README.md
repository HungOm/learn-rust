# rust gfx-hal
This is a graphics api, with some interesting tutorials.

This project will follow along the book located at 
https://lokathor.github.io/learn-gfx-hal/

I probably should also read rustonomicon just in case, but ill follow this thing until i cant anymore, then i will read the book (it sounds hard anyways).
